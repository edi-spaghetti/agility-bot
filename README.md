# agility-bot
Agility bot written with DreamBot api

One of my first attempts at a script written in Java.
It was written on a very case-by-case basis to achieve specific aims within the game at the time.

Looking back on this there's a lot to improve;

- No UI or ability to change options beyond commenting / rewriting code and recompiling
- Occasionally gets stuck in certain positions
- No ability to respond to other players
- No built in timers or configuration.
